# Status

Rustls is used in production at many organizations and projects. We aim to maintain
reasonable API surface stability but the API may evolve as we make changes to accomodate
new features or performance improvements.

We have a [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for our future plans. We also have [benchmarks](BENCHMARKING.md) to
prevent performance regressions and to let you evaluate rustls on your target hardware.

If you'd like to help out, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Approach

Rustls is a TLS library that aims to provide a good level of cryptographic security,
requires no configuration to achieve that security, and provides no unsafe features or
obsolete cryptography by default.

## Current functionality (with default crate features)

* TLS1.2 and TLS1.3.
* ECDSA, Ed25519 or RSA server authentication by clients.
* ECDSA, Ed25519 or RSA server authentication by servers.
* Forward secrecy using ECDHE; with curve25519, nistp256 or nistp384 curves.
* AES128-GCM and AES256-GCM bulk encryption, with safe nonces.
* ChaCha20-Poly1305 bulk encryption ([RFC7905](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7905)).
* ALPN support.
* SNI support.
* Tunable fragment size to make TLS messages match size of underlying transport.
* Optional use of vectored IO to minimise system calls.
* TLS1.2 session resumption.
* TLS1.2 resumption via tickets ([RFC5077](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077)).
* TLS1.3 resumption via tickets or session storage.
* TLS1.3 0-RTT data for clients.
* TLS1.3 0-RTT data for servers.
* Server and optional client authentication.
* Extended master secret support ([RFC7627](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7627)).
* Exporters ([RFC5705](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5705)).
* OCSP stapling by servers.

## Non-features

For reasons [explained in the manual](https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls/manual/_02_tls_vulnerabilities/index.html),
rustls does not and will not support:

* SSL1, SSL2, SSL3, TLS1 or TLS1.1.
* RC4.
* DES or triple DES.
* EXPORT ciphersuites.
* MAC-then-encrypt ciphersuites.
* Ciphersuites without forward secrecy.
* Renegotiation.
* Kerberos.
* TLS 1.2 protocol compression.
* Discrete-log Diffie-Hellman.
* Automatic protocol version downgrade.
* Using CA certificates directly to authenticate a server/client (often called "self-signed
certificates"). _Rustls' default certificate verifier does not support using a trust anchor as
both a CA certificate and an end-entity certificate in order to limit complexity and risk in
path building. While dangerous, all authentication can be turned off if required --
see the [example code](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/blob/992e2364a006b2e84a8cf6a7c3eaf0bdb773c9de/examples/src/bin/tlsclient-mio.rs#L318)_.

There are plenty of other libraries that provide these features should you
need them.

### Platform support

While Rustls itself is platform independent, by default it uses [`ring`] for implementing
the cryptography in TLS. As a result, rustls only runs on platforms
supported by `ring`. At the time of writing, this means 32-bit ARM, Aarch64 (64-bit ARM),
x86, x86-64, LoongArch64, 32-bit & 64-bit Little Endian MIPS, 32-bit PowerPC (Big Endian),
64-bit PowerPC (Big and Little Endian), 64-bit RISC-V, and s390x. We do not presently
support WebAssembly.
For more information, see [the supported `ring` target platforms][ring-target-platforms].

By providing a custom instance of the [`crypto::CryptoProvider`] struct, you
can replace all cryptography dependencies of rustls.  This is a route to being portable
to a wider set of architectures and environments, or compliance requirements.  See the
[`crypto::CryptoProvider`] documentation for more details.

Specifying `default-features = false` when depending on rustls will remove the
dependency on *ring*.

Rustls requires Rust 1.61 or later.

### Cryptography providers

Since Rustls 0.22 it has been possible to choose the provider of the cryptographic primitives
that Rustls uses. This may be appealing if you have specific platform, compliance or feature
requirements that aren't met by the default provider, [`ring`].

Users that wish to customize the provider in use can do so when constructing `ClientConfig`
and `ServerConfig` instances using the `with_crypto_provider` method on the respective config
builder types. See the [`crypto::CryptoProvider`] documentation for more details.

#### Built-in providers

Rustls ships with two built-in providers controlled with associated feature flags:

* [`ring`] - enabled by default, available with the `ring` feature flag enabled. This
provider is used by default when an explicit provider is not specified.
* [`aws-lc-rs`] - available with the `aws_lc_rs` feature flag enabled.

[`aws-lc-rs`]: https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs

#### Third-party providers

The community has also started developing third-party providers for Rustls:

* [`rustls-mbedtls-provider`] - a provider that uses [`mbedtls`] for cryptography.
* [`boring-rustls-provider`] - a work-in-progress provider that uses [`boringssl`] for
cryptography.

[`boring-rustls-provider`]: https://github.com/janrueth/boring-rustls-provider
[`boringssl`]: https://github.com/google/boringssl

#### Custom provider

We also provide a simple example of writing your own provider in the [`custom-provider`]
example. This example implements a minimal provider using parts of the [`RustCrypto`]
ecosystem.

See the [Making a custom CryptoProvider] section of the documentation for more information
on this topic.

# Example code

Our [examples] directory contains demos that show how to handle I/O using the
[`stream::Stream`] helper, as well as more complex asynchronous I/O using [`mio`].
If you're already using Tokio for an async runtime you may prefer to use
[`tokio-rustls`] instead of interacting with rustls directly.

The [`mio`] based examples are the most complete, and discussed below. Users
new to Rustls may prefer to look at the simple client/server examples before
diving in to the more complex MIO examples.

[`tokio-rustls`]: https://docs.rs/tokio-rustls/latest/tokio_rustls/

## Client example program
The MIO client example program is named `tlsclient-mio`.  The interface looks like:

```tlsclient-mio
Connects to the TLS server at hostname:PORT.  The default PORT
is 443.  By default, this reads a request from stdin (to EOF)
before making the connection.  --http replaces this with a
basic HTTP GET request for /.

If --cafile is not supplied, a built-in set of CA certificates
are used from the webpki-roots crate.

Usage:
  tlsclient-mio [options] [--suite SUITE ...] [--proto PROTO ...] [--protover PROTOVER ...] <hostname>
  tlsclient-mio (--version | -v)
  tlsclient-mio (--help | -h)

Options:
    -p, --port PORT     Connect to PORT [default: 443].
    --http              Send a basic HTTP GET request for /.
    --cafile CAFILE     Read root certificates from CAFILE.
    --auth-key KEY      Read client authentication key from KEY.
    --auth-certs CERTS  Read client authentication certificates from CERTS.
                        CERTS must match up with KEY.
    --protover VERSION  Disable default TLS version list, and use
                        VERSION instead.  May be used multiple times.
    --suite SUITE       Disable default cipher suite list, and use
                        SUITE instead.  May be used multiple times.
    --proto PROTOCOL    Send ALPN extension containing PROTOCOL.
                        May be used multiple times to offer several protocols.
    --no-tickets        Disable session ticket support.
    --no-sni            Disable server name indication support.
    --insecure          Disable certificate verification.
    --verbose           Emit log output.
    --max-frag-size M   Limit outgoing messages to M bytes.
    --version, -v       Show tool version.
    --help, -h          Show this screen.
```

Some sample runs:

```
$ cargo run --bin tlsclient-mio -- --http mozilla-modern.badssl.com
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.6.2 (Ubuntu)
Date: Wed, 01 Jun 2016 18:44:00 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 644
(...)
```

or

```
$ cargo run --bin tlsclient-mio -- --http expired.badssl.com
TLS error: InvalidCertificate(Expired)
Connection closed
```

## Server example program
The MIO server example program is named `tlsserver-mio`.  The interface looks like:

```tlsserver-mio
Runs a TLS server on :PORT.  The default PORT is 443.

`echo' mode means the server echoes received data on each connection.

`http' mode means the server blindly sends a HTTP response on each
connection.

`forward' means the server forwards plaintext to a connection made to
localhost:fport.

`--certs' names the full certificate chain, `--key' provides the
RSA private key.

Usage:
  tlsserver-mio --certs CERTFILE --key KEYFILE [--suite SUITE ...] [--proto PROTO ...] [--protover PROTOVER ...] [options] echo
  tlsserver-mio --certs CERTFILE --key KEYFILE [--suite SUITE ...] [--proto PROTO ...] [--protover PROTOVER ...] [options] http
  tlsserver-mio --certs CERTFILE --key KEYFILE [--suite SUITE ...] [--proto PROTO ...] [--protover PROTOVER ...] [options] forward <fport>
  tlsserver-mio (--version | -v)
  tlsserver-mio (--help | -h)

Options:
    -p, --port PORT     Listen on PORT [default: 443].
    --certs CERTFILE    Read server certificates from CERTFILE.
                        This should contain PEM-format certificates
                        in the right order (the first certificate should
                        certify KEYFILE, the last should be a root CA).
    --key KEYFILE       Read private key from KEYFILE.  This should be a RSA
                        private key or PKCS8-encoded private key, in PEM format.
    --ocsp OCSPFILE     Read DER-encoded OCSP response from OCSPFILE and staple
                        to certificate.  Optional.
    --auth CERTFILE     Enable client authentication, and accept certificates
                        signed by those roots provided in CERTFILE.
    --crl CRLFILE ...   Perform client certificate revocation checking using the DER-encoded
                        CRLFILE. May be used multiple times.
    --require-auth      Send a fatal alert if the client does not complete client
                        authentication.
    --resumption        Support session resumption.
    --tickets           Support tickets.
    --protover VERSION  Disable default TLS version list, and use
                        VERSION instead.  May be used multiple times.
    --suite SUITE       Disable default cipher suite list, and use
                        SUITE instead.  May be used multiple times.
    --proto PROTOCOL    Negotiate PROTOCOL using ALPN.
                        May be used multiple times.
    --verbose           Emit log output.
    --version, -v       Show tool version.
    --help, -h          Show this screen.
```

Here's a sample run; we start a TLS echo server, then connect to it with
`openssl` and `tlsclient-mio`:

```
$ cargo run --bin tlsserver-mio -- --certs test-ca/rsa/end.fullchain --key test-ca/rsa/end.rsa -p 8443 echo &
$ echo hello world | openssl s_client -ign_eof -quiet -connect localhost:8443
depth=2 CN = ponytown RSA CA
verify error:num=19:self signed certificate in certificate chain
hello world
^C
$ echo hello world | cargo run --bin tlsclient-mio -- --cafile test-ca/rsa/ca.cert -p 8443 localhost
hello world
^C
```
